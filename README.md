# Lab Project: Building and Testing a Fastify Node.js Server with Postman

## Overview

This lab focuses on building a Fastify Node.js server application, managing it with Postman, and handling both GET and POST requests. Participants will gain practical experience in server creation, testing API endpoints, and working with JSON responses.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Download and install Postman**
- **Create a CIT 281 collection and folders in Postman**
- **Create a Node.js and Fastify server application with GET and respond with JSON**
- **Add an array of student objects**
- **Use Postman to test server GET routes**
- **Add POST handling to the server application and respond with JSON**
- **Use Postman to send POST requests**

## Lab Structure

### Part 1: Download and Install Postman

- Install Postman, a popular API testing tool, to facilitate testing of server endpoints.

### Part 2: Create a CIT 281 Collection and Folders

- Organize your workspace in Postman by creating a collection and folders for the CIT 281 lab tasks.

### Part 3: Create a Node.js and Fastify Server Application with GET and Respond with JSON

- Set up a basic Node.js server using Fastify that handles GET requests and responds with JSON data.

### Part 4: Add Array of Student Objects

- Define and include an array of student objects in your server application.

### Part 5: Use Postman to Test Server GET Routes

- Utilize Postman to send GET requests to your server and verify the responses.

### Part 6: Add POST Handling to Server Application and Respond with JSON

- Extend your server to handle POST requests and respond with appropriate JSON data.

### Part 7: Use Postman to Send POST Requests

- Test the server's POST routes by sending POST requests via Postman and validating the responses.

By completing this lab, you will become proficient in setting up a Fastify Node.js server, managing and testing API endpoints with Postman, and handling both GET and POST requests with JSON data.
