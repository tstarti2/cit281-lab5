# Lab Project: Building and Testing a Fastify Node.js Server with Postman

Throughout this lab project, I focused on building a Fastify Node.js server application, managing it with Postman, and handling both GET and POST requests. Here's an overview of what I accomplished:

## Overview

The lab was designed to provide practical experience in server creation, testing API endpoints, and working with JSON responses using Fastify Node.js server and Postman.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Downloading and Installing Postman:** I installed Postman, a powerful API testing tool, to facilitate the testing of server endpoints.
- **Creating a CIT 281 Collection and Folders:** I organized my workspace in Postman by creating a collection and folders dedicated to the CIT 281 lab tasks.
- **Creating a Node.js and Fastify Server Application with GET and Responding with JSON:** I set up a basic Node.js server using Fastify that handled GET requests and responded with JSON data.
- **Adding Array of Student Objects:** I defined and included an array of student objects in my server application.
- **Using Postman to Test Server GET Routes:** I utilized Postman to send GET requests to my server and verified the responses, ensuring the correct functionality of the GET routes.
- **Adding POST Handling to Server Application and Responding with JSON:** I extended my server to handle POST requests and respond with appropriate JSON data, enhancing the server's capabilities.
- **Using Postman to Send POST Requests:** I tested the server's POST routes by sending POST requests via Postman and validating the responses, ensuring the proper handling of POST requests.

## Lab Experience

Throughout the lab, I followed a structured series of exercises that allowed me to:

- Set up a Fastify Node.js server application capable of handling both GET and POST requests.
- Manage and organize API testing tasks using Postman collections and folders.
- Test server endpoints efficiently using Postman, ensuring proper functionality and response handling.
- Work with JSON data to provide structured responses from the server, enhancing interoperability and readability.
- Gain practical experience in handling both GET and POST requests, key aspects of web server development.

By completing this lab, I gained valuable hands-on experience in building, testing, and managing a Fastify Node.js server with Postman, a skill set essential for modern web development.
